This project is a Python-based pathfinding visualizer built using Pygame. It features a custom dictionary-driven pathfinding algorithm developed from scratch, offering a unique approach to navigating grid-based environments. The visualizer allows users to interactively place start and end points, draw obstacles, and observe the algorithm in action as it calculates the optimal path.

 Features

- Interactive grid interface using Pygame
- Custom dictionary-based pathfinding algorithm
- Real-time visualization of pathfinding steps
- User-controlled placement of start/end nodes and barriers
- Clear/reset functionality for multiple runs

Algorithm Overview

this project uses a dictionary-based approach to track node relationships and path costs. The algorithm builds a map of accessible nodes and iteratively selects the most promising path based on stored values, offering a fresh perspective on pathfinding logic.

Technologies Used

Python 3.9
Pygame – for rendering the grid and handling user input
Custom Dictionary Algorithm – designed and implemented from scratch
